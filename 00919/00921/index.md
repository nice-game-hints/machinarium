# Hint 1
Fiddle around a little, and you'll soon figure out the objective of the puzzle.

# Hint 2
You need to send the green lights over the entire board, save for any red lit squares.

# Hint 3
The first puzzle doesn't have any red lights at all, so you just need to click on a square, then continue clicking in directions from it until you've filled every square with green.

# Hint 4
For this first one, place your first square in the upper-left, then go in a clockwise square spiral to fill in all the gaps.

# Hint 5
They will get a little tougher from here on in, as red blocks will appear to stop the flow of green lights.

# Hint 6
So in the second puzzle, the easiest place to start from is the fourth square from the right on the bottom row.

# Hint 7
From there, go left, up, right, down, left, up, right, down, right.

# Hint 8
Third puzzle: start on the far right, fourth row down, and go: down, left, up, right, down, left, down, right, up.

# Hint 9
Fourth puzzle: start on the second row, in the middle, and go: down, left, down, right, up, right, up, left, down.

# Hint 10
Fifth puzzle: start on the second row, second column, and go: up, left, down, right, up, right, down, right, down, left, up, left, down, left.

# Hint 11
And for the sixth one, start on the third row, second column, and head down, left,  up, right, down, right, down, left, up, right, down.
