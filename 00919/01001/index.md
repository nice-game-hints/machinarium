title: How can I grow a sunflower?
---
# Hint 1
You're actually going to need the plant from way back with the musicians for this, but you should already have that in your inventory as you will have picked it up when you picked up the radio.

# Hint 2
Use it with the empty plant pot at the left, then move the laser to it and power it up using the grid panel (after solving its puzzles).

# Hint 4
Doing so will cause the sunflower to grow, and you can collect some of its seeds by shaking it.
