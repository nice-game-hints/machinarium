title: Getting your arm back
order: 30
---

If you blinked and missed it during the opening cutscene, then I'm sorry to say that your arm is at the bottom of the nearby pond.

# What should I do?
Now that you can [walk around](missingleg), you should look for something that could help you pull it out.

# Like what?
Something long and stringy, and something else for the arm to get stuck to.

# String?
Moving your mouse around the screen can be helpful when looking for items in this artstyle. See the quickhint for more help. ^[You'll find a long spool of wire next to the pond.]

# What else do I need?
Assuming our robot friend is made of something magnetic, a magnet would do the job. See the quickhint for help. ^[You'll find a magnet stuck to a fan on the left, near where your head landed.]

# What now?
Combine the two items like the game tells you, then look for something to dangle the new creation from.

# Hmm...
Look for something long and sturdy to tie the wire around. The closer it is to the pond, the better.

## Help me out.
Push the large metal rod so that it's leaning over the lake, then use your magnet-string on it to complete your repairs. After that, head onwards - [to freedom!](outskirts)
