title: Getting your leg back
order: 20
---

Being able to move around would certainly be nice.

# What do I do?
There's a strange creature running around. Now that you've got a head, you might be able to ask it for help.

# Hmm...
It seems a trade has been arranged; get the creature's toy, and you'll get your other leg.

# What do I do?
Fixing your head unlocked the ability to grow taller. ^[That should help you grab anything that's usually out of reach.]

## Help me out.
Click on your head to get bigger, then grab the toy that's sitting on top of some junk. You can then give it to the strange creature to [get your leg back.](missingarm)
