title: Getting your leg back
order: 20
---

Being able to move around would certainly be nice.

# What do I do?
There's a strange creature running around; having a head might let you communicate with it and ask for help..

# Hmm...
It seems a trade has been arranged; the creature's toy for your other leg.

# What do I do?
Fixing your head unlocked the ability to grow taller. ^[That should help you grab anything that's usually out of reach.]

## Help me out.
Click on your head to get bigger, then grab the toy sitting atop some junk. You can then give it to the strange creature to [get your leg back.](missingarm)
