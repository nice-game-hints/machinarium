Let's hope it still works.

# What do I do?
It's easy to miss, but the game encourages you to start by clicking on the bathtub - twice.

# What now?
It seems your body was able to kick the bathtub away. Can it move, too?

## Help me out.
Click your body twice to have it hop down next to your head.

# What now?
You can't interact with your body anymore, but it's right next to your head.

## What do I do?
Click on your head to reattach it. Much better, but [still not whole!](missingleg)
