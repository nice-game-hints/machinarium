title: What's my goal here?

# Hint 1
Put very simply: to get that cat on the upper-right side of the screen.

# Hint 2
It'll take you a few other mini-puzzles before you'll manage it, but I'll try to provide some very arbitrary hints to the screen as a whole.

# Hint 3
The robot fixing those wires will provide you access to the cat.

# Hint 4
But you'll need to find a way to make it stay still. And, you're going to have to hurt it.

# Hint 5
In fact, you'll be electrocuting it.

# Hint 6
Basically you're going to be breaking that electrical cable over the bridge, tying it onto the bridge, restoring power to the cable, and then making the cat head to the bridge.

# Hint 7
[How can I reach the cat?][643]

# Hint 8
Click on the cat after electrifying the bridge, and you will send him down to get shocked.

# Hint 9
Now all that remains is to turn off the power again (by pulling that tile out of the puzzle, or just moving one of the blocks to disrupt the white line), and grab the cat as your prize.
