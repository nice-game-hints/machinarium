title: How can I restore power to the cable?
---
# Hint 1
This involves solving the puzzle inside the little lightning-bolt compartment on the power pole.

# Hint 2
It's a standard slider puzzle really, with one thing added to make it easier.

# Hint 3
Or one thing removed, actually.

# Hint 4
Of the nine blocks, only seven stay in place. Fiddle for a bit, and one will fall out.

# Hint 5
You can now arrange all of the other seven blocks, and then simply put this extra one in at the end. Makes it much easier to move the tiles around in the tight space.

# Hint 6
The goal of the slider puzzle itself is to construct a white line with no breaks in it that goes from the bottom middle tile to the top middle one.

# Hint 7
The two empty slots, before you insert your other tile, will be the upper-left and lower-right ones.

# Hint 8
The path of the white line (the wire) will go from the bottom middle to the bottom left, then the middle-left. It'll then go off the tile (onto the one you'll be adding later above it) and continue on to the middle-middle tile, then to the middle-right, upper-right, and finally the upper-middle.

# Hint 9
Adding in that last tile will restore power to the cable -- and electrify the bridge.
