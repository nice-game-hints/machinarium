title: How can I reach the cat?
---
# Hint 1
The ladder robot is on the wrong side of the platform.

# Hint 2
He's doing some fiddling with those red cables. Perhaps if we gave him reason to fiddle with the cables on the right side instead of the left, he'd move?

# Hint 3
You can climb his ladder and actually stand on his head.

# Hint 4
If you do this, you can unplug the drill he's using.

# Hint 5
While he's plugging it back in, pull the red cables (from the floor).

# Hint 6
He will then move over to the other side and you can climb him again to reach the cat.
