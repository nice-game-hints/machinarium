title: How can I break the cable over the bridge?
---
# Hint 1
The first thing to do here is to look at the bird sitting on the power pole.

# Hint 2
He's your solution.

# Hint 3
Notice that he seems to be copying everything you do.

# Hint 4
If you move onto the bridge, he will move onto the cable.

# Hint 5
And, if you were on that cable, how might YOU break it?

# Hint 6
Perhaps applying pressure continually by shifting your weight back and forth until it snapped?

# Hint 7
Or if not back and forth, then... another dimension?

# Hint 8
Up and down, maybe?

# Hint 9
Don't forget that you can stretch and squish yourself.

# Hint 10
The bird will try to copy this behavior.

# Hint 11
So, if you stand on the bridge and extend/shrink yourself a few times in a steady motion, the bird will break the cable and fall to the bridge.
