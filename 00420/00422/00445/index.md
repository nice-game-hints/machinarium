title: How can I lure the pet out?
---
# Hint 1
You're going to need to feed him. He's a robot, what do robots like?

# Hint 2
Oil!

# Hint 3
See the buoy in the water? That's got an oil symbol on it, and a little tap too -- looks like we could get it to squirt oil somehow if we could control it.

# Hint 4
To do that, you're going to need to find your way up to the platform on the upper-left overlooking the water.

# Hint 5
See that ladder leading up to it? The ladder that begins halfway up the wall? You need a boost to get up there.

# Hint 6
Those red crates are perfect.

# Hint 7
Well actually, one would be perfect, because two are too high to climb.

# Hint 8
Push the crates to the left, onto the screen with the pink robot.

# Hint 9
See that magnet at the top, next to the stairs?

# Hint 10
Push the crates under it, and then use the control panel at the top of the stairs to turn it on.

# Hint 12
The magnet will now pull up one of the crates, meaning that you can push the other one back to the right screen where it began.

# Hint 13
You can then climb it via the little mooring post next to it (to its right) and stretch up to reach the ladder.

# Hint 14
Now, at the control panel, just send the buoy to the right edge and push the red oil-drop button to pump out some oil and attract the pet.
