title: How can I return the pink robot's pet?
---
# Hint 1
If you haven't found the pet yet, explore a little until it turns up.

# Hint 2
It's on the far right of the screen at the right side of the tower, on the other side of the water beside the buoy.

# Hint 3
You're going to need to find a way to pull it over here.

# Hint 4
Perhaps some of the items you found inside the prison would be useful?

# Hint 5
[The Other Prison Cell][373]

# Hint 6
You can combine items in your inventory, remember.

# Hint 7
Combine the rope gun with the plunger and try to catch the pet robot with it from the far side of the water.

# Hint 8
No good? It looks like he's hiding behind that can. Perhaps we can lure him out into the open so that we can catch him unhindered.

# Hint 9
[How can I lure the pet out?][445]

# Hint 10
Once the pet is drinking the oil, use your plunger-gun again to catch him.

# Hint 11
You can then just go and give him back to the owner.

# Hint 12
She will give you her umbrella in return, meaning you can pass the dripping water and go onto the next screen.
