title: How can I follow the bully into the upper-right pipe?
---
# Hint 1
You're going to need to use the pincer mechanism to do this.

# Hint 2
However, first off, you're going to need to figure out how it works.

# Hint 3
There's a control panel at the right of the furnace that allows you to control it.

# Hint 4
In order to move it, you need to move sliders 1 and 3 all the way down, and the middle one (2) all the way up, and then push the red button.

# Hint 5
This will cause the pincers to grab something from the mine cart.

# Hint 6
It would even grab YOU from the mine cart, were you in it at the time.

# Hint 7
Run back there after pushing the red button (don't forget to de-extend yourself so you can walk faster), and the pincers will grab you and carry you around.

# Hint 8
You can jump off onto the platform at the upper left.

# Hint 9
There's another control panel here but you can't open it without the right tool.

[Where can I find this tool?](/00193/00195/00220/index.md)


# Hint 11
Use the tool with the control panel and you will discover that it allows you to switch the rotational direction of the pincers.

# Hint 12
This means that if you switch the red and black wires on the upper-left terminal, you can move the pincers clockwise.

# Hint 13
This means they will move past the upper-right pipe.

# Hint 14
So now, just climb down and repeat the process of pushing the red button, running over to the pincers, and then instead of jumping onto the upper-left platform, jump into the upper-right pipe.
