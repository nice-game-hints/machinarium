title: How can I get to the right side of the bathroom?
---
# Hint 1
You're going to need to be very heavy handed here.

# Hint 2
First of all, notice that the lever on the far left of the room controls the vacuuming robot.

# Hint 3
Second of all, notice that you can climb on that robot to reach higher things, such as the scissors in the bathroom, which you should take right now.

# Hint 4
Okay, we need to find an anchor of some sort in these two rooms.

# Hint 5
Search high and low for one.

# Hint 6
Mainly high.

# Hint 7
We can use the chandelier, if we can reach it.

# Hint 8
Move the cleaning robot under the lights, switch them off via the switch next to the bathroom door, and climb up there.

# Hint 9
Use your scissors to cut them down.

# Hint 10
Now tie the chandelier onto the cleaning bot, and send him back into the bathroom.

# Hint 11
Now, attach the chandelier to the toilet bowl, and head back into the hall.

# Hint 12
Use the lever, and the toilet will be ripped away, leaving a gaping hole in the floor.
