title: How can I escape from the cell?
---
# Hint 1
That manhole on the floor is your way out. You need a kind of sewer key to open it.

# Hint 2
Can you see anything in the cell that looks like it might fit the hole in the top of the manhole cover?

# Hint 3
It looks almost like a propeller.

# Hint 4
There's a valve on the pipe at the right of the room which, with two clicks, will fall off.

# Hint 5
Did you get the broom yet?

# Hint 6
If not, help the prisoner first.

# Hint 8
Combine the broom and valve, and you can use the resulting item like a manhole key to escape.

# Hint 9
Climb down, and squish yourself, then proceed to the right until you find the next manhole.

# Hint 10
Use the broom one more time to get up into the guard's break room.
