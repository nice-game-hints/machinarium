title: How can I get a cigarette for the prisoner?
---
# Hint 1
You're going to need to be VERY loose about your definition of a cigarette here.

# Hint 2
It's effectively some kind of burned leaves wrapped in some kind of paper.

# Hint 3
Well, the paper's easy. There's toilet paper!

# Hint 4
As for the leaves -- think more... fungus, than leaves.

# Hint 5
See that gross green stuff on the right side of the room?

# Hint 6
Grab it, and you can use it as leaves, if you can burn them.

# Hint 7
To do that, you need to place them on a source of heat.

# Hint 8
There's only one in the room, and you can reach it with your extending torso.

# Hint 9
Place the fungus on the lamp at the upper-left and they will brown and look a little more like tobacco.

# Hint 10
Use this with the toilet roll in your inventory and you can then give the resulting "cigarette" to the prisoner.
