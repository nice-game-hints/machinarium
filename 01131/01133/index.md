title: How can I figure out how to use the elevator?
---
# Hint 1
See those scribbles on the wall?

# Hint 2
Those are the key here.

# Hint 3
And the REAL key is realizing something about them that a two-dimensional screen hides quite well.

# Hint 4
There's another scribble hidden behind the plant -- extend up there and take a look at it.

# Hint 5
Remember it. Write it down.

# Hint 6
Now, we need to find the missing bulb for the controls.

# Hint 7
Throw some dirt from that plant on the floor and see what happens.

# Hint 8
Did you see that little cleaning robot scurry out?

# Hint 9
Grab him when he's next there.

# Hint 10
He will drop the bulb you need.

# Hint 11
Now, set about making the pattern you saw behind the plant on the elevator bulbs. You need to draw in straight lines from one to another.

# Hint 12
The shape is a five point star, so giving the eight bulbs numbers clockwise with the top being one, click them as follows:

# Hint 13
1, 6, 2, 8, 4, and 1.

# Hint 14
The elevator will then move you to your next destination.
