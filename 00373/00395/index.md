title: How can I open the locked cabinet?
---
# Hint 1
You need to solve the red and green triangle puzzle on the front of the door to open it.

# Hint 2
This puzzle can be devious or can be simple, and I'm afraid it's all the luck of the draw -- it's randomized.

# Hint 3
What you need to do is actually quite simple, however.

# Hint 4
You just need to cycle the three circles so that each of the six circles in the green triangle has a green circle in it, not a red one.

# Hint 5
To do this, you're going to need to put four of them adjacently around the six spots in one circle, then two more in an adjacent circle with one red circle between them.

# Hint 6
Give it a fiddle, and you'll get it eventually. It took me around ten minutes of idle clicking to get ^_^

# Hint 7
Now, once you've opened the cabinet, it's time to explore the city by heading out of the door at the top of the stairs in the observatory -- the door just next to the telescope.
