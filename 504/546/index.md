title: Where can I find some oil for the wheelchair robot?
---
# Hint 1
Did you explore the lower city yet?

# Hint 2
There's a path to the left of the musicians that will take you to the drawbridge. To the side you should've gotten to a lot earlier, in fact.

# Hint 3
And there's an oil spill there.

# Hint 4
Grab some oil in the can the wheelchair robot gave you, and take it back to him.

# Hint 5
Hmm, it looks like he's after sunflower oil in particular.

# Hint 6
Take the can back, and he'll let you down into the sewer beneath him.
