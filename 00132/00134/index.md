title: How can I get inside the building here?
---
# Hint 1
You're going to need to go as a mine cart would.

# Hint 2
Along the tracks.

# Hint 3
Explore the scene and try to work out how to summon a mine cart.

# Hint 4
That lever at the top of the stairs will call one, and send it through.

# Hint 5
However, we're going to need more than that. We're going to need a way to pull that lever from the tracks, and we're also going to need to mount ourselves on some wheels so that we'll glide inside when the cart does come.

# Hint 6
[How can I make a mine cart stop to get some wheels?][163]

# Hint 7
Once you've put the wheels on the track, sit on them, and pull the lever once more. You will then be pushed inside.
