title: How can I make a mine cart stop to get some wheels?
---
# Hint 1
You're going to need to cause a little accident here.

# Hint 2
And to do so, you're going to need to find a way to grab that yellow chock that's hanging up at the top of the screen. See it?

# Hint 3
Have you fiddled with the control panel below the little silo yet? You can shrink yourself, as well as grow, and get down there to reach it.

# Hint 4
Fiddle with the controls and eventually you'll work out how to get a pipe extended out to the yellow chock.

# Hint 5
Set the left control to 2, and the right one to A, and then push the red button.

# Hint 6
You can now climb the stairs and extend your body to hook onto the pipe, and shimmy along it to the far right to grab the chock.

# Hint 7
Now, use the chock with the tracks and pull the lever remotely to make a cart crash.

# Hint 8
[How can I pull the lever remotely?][148]

# Hint 9
You can then steal the wheels from the cart.
