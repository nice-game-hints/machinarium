title: How can I pull the lever remotely?
---
# Hint 1
Look at the banister of the stairway, that's the clue here.

# Hint 2
There's something about it. Specifically, about one end, which is different from the other end.

# Hint 3
That hook-shaped thing -- it's on the bottom end, but not the top.

# Hint 4
But, you can see another hook up there. It's just fallen off, that's all.

# Hint 5
Grab it, and re-attach it.

# Hint 6
You can now pull the lever from the bottom of the stairs.
