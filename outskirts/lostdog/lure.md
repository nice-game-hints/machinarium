title: Luring the dog into position
order: 20
---

The [plunger-gun](plunger) will bring the dog to this side of the water, but he's hiding out of sight. Maybe you could lure him out with some oil?

# What should I do?
There's an oil tank in the middle of the water, and a radar dish above your head is pointed right at it.

# How does that help me?
I'll bet it's a control room! You might be able to climb onto a crate to reach that ladder, but two crates? No way.

# What should I do?
You can click on the right side of the crates to push them offscreen. That might be a good start.

# Hmm...
Push the crates into the area with the umbrella lady and they'll end up right beneath a magnet. It doesn't seem to be working, though.

# What should I do?
A closer look at the panel near the stairs reveals the problem - these arrows are all in the wrong position! The 'up' arrows need to be at the top, and down arrows need to be at the bottom.

# Hmm...
The arrows can move through each other, but only if there's a spot free on the other side - and you can only 'undo' your most recent move.

# Can I get a nudge?
Certainly - press the red button to reset the puzzle, then start like this:
* Move the upmost 'up' arrow
* Move the lowest 'down' arrow
* Move the middle 'down' arrow.

## Give me the solution.
The down arrow at the top of the stack is 1, with the two below it being 2 and 3. The up arrow at the top is 4, with the two below it being 5 and 6. 
With that in mind, press the red button to reset the puzzle, then press the arrows in this order:
* Up arrow 4
* Down arrow 3
* Down arrow 2
* Up arrow 4
* Up arrow 5
* Up arrow 6
* Down arrow 3
* Down arrow 2
* Down arrow 1
* Up arrow 4
* Up arrow 5
* Up arrow 6
* Down arrow 2
* Down arrow 1
* Up arrow 6

Then pull the lever and you're done!

# What now?
Push the crate back to its starting point, then climb on top of it. You'll then be able to reach the ladder by stretching up.

# What do we have here?
Another puzzle, of course! This one's simpler than it looks, with the bulbs on the board representing the only directions that the tank can go.

## Tell me what to do.
Press the blank buttons until the display shows an arrow pointing towards the bottom-right, then press the triangle button. When the tank's in position, press the oil button to lure out the dog.

# What now?
The dog's vulnerable - use your plunger-gun to snatch him up, then reunite him with his owner!

# What do I do now?
Use the umbrella to walk safely under the gushing water, and after a short walk up some long stairs, you'll enter [the city](city) at long last.
