title: Getting a plunger-gun
order: 10
---

The dog you're looking for is in plain view near the building you just exited. Click the dog, and our protagonist will get the idea to grab it with a plunger-gun.

# Where will I find one?
The criminal gang we've been dealing with seems to have all kinds of gadgets. They probably have a spare gun in their storage area.

# Storage area? Where?
While escaping the jail earlier, you got a broom from a storage room near the cells. That might be a good place to start.

# Locked!
To get in, you'll need a code that seems to be based on hours and minutes. ^[Have you seen a clock anywhere?]

# Hmm...
There's a clock in the room with the telescope, but it's going wild. ^[Can you change the way you look at it?]

## What do I do?
You can click the lightswitch near the door to see the clock in a new light.

## What is the code?
When the lights are off, the strangely designed clock highlights '4' with its hour hand and '45' with its minute hand. Return to the storage cell and get inside with code 04:45.

# What now?
This criminal gang is serious about security! You'll need to rotate three circles until the green section in the middle is exclusively filled by green dots.

# How does it work?
Look closely at the circles; they're all responsible for 6 dots, have 3-4 dots in the green area, and can be moved either left / right, or up / down. You need to move all of the red dots into the grey area.

# Hmm...
Keep these things in mind:
* Each circle only has 2 spots for red dots.
* You need to get 6 green dots into the green area
* The red dots will end up side-by-side

## Help me out.
The game randomises this puzzle when you leave and re-enter the cell, making it difficult to give specific tips. If you're stumped, it may be worth attempting another layout.

# Gun acquired!
Nice! That's just a regular gun, though. For a plunger, you'll might need to look around rooms that have toilets in them.

## Help me find a plunger.
Visit the empty cell that was next to yours earlier, then grow in size to grab a plunger off the ceiling. Don't forget to [combine it with the gun, too!](lure)
