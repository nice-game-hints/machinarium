title: Distracting the bully
order: 50

Watch out, he's got a gun - with unlimited ammo!

# Unlimited ammo?!
It certainly seems that way; the plate in front of him is well-stocked.

# What do I do?
If the security monitors are any indication, then it seems our gunslinger is supposed to be watching the prisoners. Maybe the key-holes unlock their cells?

# Hmm...
The key is on the gunslinger's belt, but if you reach for it, he'll spot you. Try getting him out of his chair.

# How do I do that?
He's having a great time shooting the target, but if he ran out of bullets, he'd have to get up for more. ^[Force him out of the chair - he's not exactly sitting properly.]

## Help me out.
Click on one of the chair's legs to knock the gunslinger over, then steal his bullets. You can then take his key while he's distracted.

# What now?
Now we need to get the gunslinger out of the room entirely; a breakout would do the job, but you'll need to stop him from just grabbing the prisoners again.

# How do I do that?
Those bullets are perfectly round. ^[Probably quite slippery, too.]

## Help me out.
While the gunslinger is distracted, put the bullets you stole on the ground. Now, you just need to release the prisoners.

## How do I do that?
Use the key you stole on the panel beneath the monitors. If you take too long, you'll need to push the chair over and steal the bullets again - but after that, you're [free to go!](lostdog)
