title: The furnace room
order: 30
---

It seems the only way out of this room is via that big pipe in the corner.

# What do I need to do?
If in doubt, start pushing buttons. The button on the right may be of interest.

# Hmm...
Pressing the button made a claw swing around the room. You might be able to swing yourself into the pipe - if you can avoid the flames.

# How do I do that?
Look closely at the wires all throughout the room. Where do they lead? ^[The grey wire leads to a button you can press.]

# How does that help me?
When you click the small button beneath the 'danger: fire' sign, a panel is opened. With it, you can interfere with the claw's controls.

# Hmm...
The panel isn't too complicated - the numbers are the order that the actions are performed, and the claw has two options - drop, or spin.

## Help me out.
You need to give yourself enough time to get in the minecart, so move the levers into these positions:
* 1 - Spin
* 2 - Drop
* 3 - Spin

You should then press the button and hop into the minecart.

# Hmm...
You got close to victory - but closer to death. The wires also seem to lead to a panel on the upper-left side of the room, though.

# It's closed!
Are there any tools in this room that can help you get it open? ^[Grab the wrench hanging by the door on the right.]

# What now?
When the claw picks you up, click the ledge on the left to hop out. You can then use the wrench for a closer look at the wires inside.

# How does this help me?
Keep following the wires with your eyes; the blue one controls the direction the claw spins, and yellow one is responsible for picking you up.

## Tell me what to do.
The only wires you need to click are the ones in the upper-left corner, part of the blue circuit. You can then hop down, activate the claw, and get in the minecart to progress - just don't forget to click the pipe as you [swing around!](jail)
