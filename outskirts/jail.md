title: Escaping the cell
order: 40
---

It seems you aren't the only victim of these bullies.

# What do I do?
You're not alone here; maybe your roommate can help you escape? ^[Try talking to him.]

# Hmm...
For whatever reason, this bot is craving a cigarette. You'll need to make one for him.

# How do I do that?
You'll need two things - a plant, and some paper to roll it up in.

# Hmm...
The toilet paper is a suitable casing, but the moss in the pipe is too wet to smoke. ^[Can you dry it out?]

## Help me out.
Put the moss on top of the cell's light, combine it with the toilet paper, and give it to your cellmate. Far out, man!

# What now?
You've got an extra arm, and there seems to be small holes connecting each cell. They're pretty low-down, though. ^[Maybe you could peek into your neighbours' cell by shrinking?]

# Hmm...
Use your cellmate's arm while peeking into the other cell to have a feel around, and look closely - there may be other cells to check out.

## Help me out.
Use the arm to explore two holes on the left side of your neighbours' cell - one has a broom inside, which you can get by clicking the cabinet it's resting on repeatedly.

# What do I do with this?
On its own, a broom isn't very useful - but check out the grate on the floor! If you stuck something to the end of the broom, you could twist the grate loose.

# What do you suggest?
The extra arm was returned to its rightful owner, so you'll need to check your cell again.

## Help me out.
Grab a valve from the pipe you got the moss from, then combine it with the broom for the perfect grate-twister. [Freedom at last!](gunguy)
