title: Getting through the shutter
order: 20
---

That was quite the fall! Good thing there's no guards down here.

# What do I do?
If in doubt, pull a lever. You'll unleash a minecart that rockets down the hill and through the shutter door.

# How does that help me?
If you stopped the minecart, you could hop inside. You'll need to find an item to help with that, though.

# Hmm...
Look at the upper half of the screen - a useful-looking doodad is hanging up here, far out of reach.

# What do I do?
You might be able to climb along the big metal rod, but it's too high to reach. Maybe you could move it?

# How do I do that?
Look around for controls; you'll probably find them near the door.

## Help me out.
While standing near the door, shrink the robot down. You'll then be able to interact with a panel that can move the metal rod.

# Hmm...
Your goal here is to move the metal rod down so that it's *just* low enough to grab while in your tall form. The closer it is to the top of the stairs, the better.

# How does the panel work?
The leftmost hole is 1, one to its right is 2, and so on. 'A' seems to be the highest row, too, and pressing the red button moves the metal rod into its new position.

## Help me out.
Move the rod into hole A-2, climb the stairs, then grow tall. You can then reach the item and lay it on the tracks.

# What now?
Pulling the lever should send a minecart crashing into the tower; if it goes offscreen, you'll need to reposition the block to be on the lower side.

# Seems a bit broken!
Maybe - but don't let that stop you! Grab the wheels and our robot friend will get the option to sit on them. All he needs now is a good push.

# Hmm...
The lever to summon minecarts is at the top of the stairs. You can't be in two places at once, so will need to pull the lever while sitting at the bottom of the stairs..

# How do I do that?
You can push the stairs' handrail while sitting down. ^[The curved bit at the top of the stairs has been broken off.]

## Help me out.
Climb the stairs one last time, grab the curved piece of metal, and put it on the end of the handrail. You can then push it while sitting on the wheels to finally [get inside the building.](furnace)
