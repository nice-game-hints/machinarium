title: How can I get a light for the top of my hat?
---
# Hint 1
There's only one light here!

# Hint 2
It's the one on top of the street lamp.

# Hint 3
You're going to need to find a way to climb up there.

# Hint 4
If only these rungs on either side of the lamp post didn't stop.

# Hint 5
Wait, do you see that there are more holes in the lamp post, almost as if more rungs should go there?

# Hint 6
Perhaps if we climb as high as we can...

# Hint 7
...then we won't need the BOTTOM rung, as we'll have already climbed past it.

# Hint 8
Grab the bottom rung when you've climbed above it, and insert it into the first of the empty holes.

# Hint 9
Now climb up one more, and repeat that process.

# Hint 10
Now, you can climb right to the top, and stretch out to reach the light bulb.
