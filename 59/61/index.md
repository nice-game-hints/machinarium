title: How can I get across the drawbridge?
---
# Hint 1
Check out how the guard got past.

# Hint 2
He pulled that pulley, and the other guy saw him, and let him in.

# Hint 3
I guess he's only going to let another guard through though.

# Hint 4
The fact that he's a guard was indicated by something -- something both the guy in the tower and the guy crossing the bridge had.

# Hint 5
Something they were wearing, specifically.

# Hint 6
That rather specific blue cone-shaped hat with the flashing light on top.

# Hint 7
You're going to need to cook up one of those for yourself.

# Hint 8
You'll need a cone, which is light blue in color, and a light for the top.

# Hint 9
The cone itself can be found easily -- there are some orange and white traffic cones right there. Grab one!

# Hint 10
[How can I get a light for the top of my hat?][103]

# Hint 11
Combine the bulb and cone, and use it with yourself.

# Hint 12
You can now pull the pulley to call the guard, and he will let you across.

# Hint 13
Unfortunately, you won't quite make it that far...
