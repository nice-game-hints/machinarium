title: How can I beat the robot at his five-in-a-row game?
---
# Hint 1
It's actually much easier than it looks.

# Hint 2
The idea is to trap him.

# Hint 3
Make it so that you have four in a row, and a spare space to both sides.

# Hint 4
This means that whichever side he tries to block you on, you'll still be able to complete a fifth move.

# Hint 5
Start by laying out diagonals to make the play-board smaller -- pin him into one area.

# Hint 6
Now start laying them out.

# Hint 7
You shouldn't have too much trouble but since his moves and the starting positions are random there's really no way I can give more direct hints.

# Hint 8
Keep at it!
