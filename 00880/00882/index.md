title: How can I repair the lift?
---
# Hint 1
You're going to need to get that piece of metal off the stove pipe first.

# Hint 2
While you have control of the female robot, grab the corncob from the cupboard.

# Hint 3
Place it on the stove (moving the pot to the floor first).

# Hint 4
This will create popcorn coming from the chimney, and will knock the metal to the floor.

# Hint 5
You can now give the metal to the female robot, who can use it (while standing atop the pot) to reach the cabinet at the top of the room.

# Hint 6
There's a pipe inside, but it's frozen.

# Hint 7
To unfreeze it, simply heat it up.

# Hint 8
Put the pot back on the stove, and put the pipe in the pot.

# Hint 9
You can then attach the pipe to the oil and give it to the male robot outside, and he will siphon oil to the lift to power it.
