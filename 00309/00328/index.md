title: Okay, he's distracted -- now how can I get out of here?

# Hint 1
This one's a little protracted.

# Hint 2
See that key around his waist?

# Hint 3
You can grab it while he's pulling pellets from the board.

# Hint 4
And you can sneak up and unlock the cells using that little control panel near the stairs, if you're quick.

# Hint 5
The left cell has those two weird other characters in it -- let them out.

# Hint 6
They will ALMOST make it out through the door at the top of the stairs before the guard turns around and spots them, and chases them back into their cell.

# Hint 7
Perhaps if we could make him have some trouble getting back to their cell?

# Hint 8
Let's lay a trap for him.

# Hint 9
He'd certainly slip on some of the pellets. Throw some on the floor in front of the control panel.

# Hint 10
Now repeat the process, and when he goes to chase the prisoners back into their cell, he'll go flying and end up in the other room.

# Hint 11
He'll run back, but the other prisoners will have already escaped, and he will follow them.

# Hint 12
You should follow them out of the door at the top of the stairs.
