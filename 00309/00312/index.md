title: How can I distract the guard?
---
# Hint 1
What could we do to him from our position under the table here?

# Hint 2
When he leans back on his chair, it'd be pretty easy for us to push him over -- but what good would that do? He'd just get up again.

# Hint 3
You need to find a way to make him move over to the dart board. When does a player usually walk to the dart board?

# Hint 4
When they've thrown all their darts!

# Hint 5
So, push him over, then quickly grab all the remaining BBs from the bowl on his table before he gets up. He'll then move over to the dart board to collect more.
