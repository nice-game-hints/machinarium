title: How can I stop water from getting to the fountain?
---
# Hint 1
You're going to need three red valves to make this work.

# Hint 2
One can be found by getting the help of the wrench-bot, and one, by looking inside the book in the drawer of his cabinet. On the last page you'll find a valve hidden.

# Hint 3
[How can I convince the wrench-bot to help me?][801]

# Hint 4
The third valve is already on the wall, so let's get to work.

# Hint 5
The idea is to follow the pipes with your eyes and place the three valves at positions which will stop any water from flowing to the third pipe from the left.

# Hint 6
There are two rows of places you can put the valves. The first one has six slots and the lower one has five.

# Hint 7
Place two of your valves on the first two locations on the upper row (first two from the left, that is).

# Hint 8
And place the other valve on the second from the left on the lower row.
