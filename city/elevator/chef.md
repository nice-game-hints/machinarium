title: Refuelling the elevator
order: 10
---

Only enough fuel for one trip? Not a very useful elevator!

# What do I need to do?
There's not much to see out here, so you might want to try peeking through the window.

# Oh!
Hey, that's your girlfriend! Maybe she can help you borrow some fuel from the dispenser on the left?

# What do I need?
A hose would be useful! There seems to be something hose-like in the air conditioner above Berta, but it's just out of reach.

# Hmm...
There's not much in the kitchen, but look at the wall above the elevator - a long pole is stuck to a pipe coming out of the kitchen.

# How does that help me?
If you sent something up into the pipe via the kitchen, it might be shaken loose. ^[Search the kitchen for anything useful.]

# What am I looking for?
There's some corn in a cupboard - you might be able to send some popcorn up into the vent.

## Help me out.
Put the pot on the floor, then throw the corn onto the heat. The pole will be knocked loose soon after, and you can use it on the window to give it to Berta.

# What now?
You can hop onto the pot for a height boost, and the pole will do the rest. Get that air conditioner open!

# Hmm...
Just out of reach. You might need to knock that hose loose. ^[You've still got the pole.]

# What now?
The hose should do the job, but it's frozen solid. Can you fix that?

## Help me out.
Put the pot back on the heat, then add the hose to thaw it out.

# What now?
The hose is ready to transport oil - hook it up to the oil dispenser and you're [good to go!](fixlift)
