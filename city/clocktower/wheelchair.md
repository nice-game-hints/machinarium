title: Helping the wheelchair-bound robot
order: 10
---

The robot sitting by the fountain needs some oil to get his wheelchair working, and he's given you a can to store it in.

# Where will I find oil?
The bar seemed to sell it, but for an exorbitant price. Maybe you can find it elsewhere?

# Hmm...
Remember slipping off the bridge earlier? Wasn't it a puddle of oil that caused the accident?

# How does that help me?
If you found the bridge, you might be able to scoop up the oil. ^[It had a blue-and-white doorway.]

## Help me find the bridge.
Return to the area where the band are playing, then go through the gateway next to them. You can then use the can to gather some oil, and bring it back to the wheelchair-bound robot.

# What now?
That got him moving! He wants a different kind of oil, so you should take his can but can worry about filling it later. For now, why not check out the [now-accessible grate?](radio)
