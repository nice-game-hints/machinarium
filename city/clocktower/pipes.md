title: Fixing the pipes
order: 30
---

The big tank is empty, but you'll need to switch off the water completely if you want to progress.

# How do I do that?
There's a staggering number of pipes near the tank. You'll need three wrenches in very strategic spots to switch off the fountain, however.

# Where will I find the wrenches?
You got one for [emptying the tank](radio), and one is already holding a pipe shut. The other is somewhere in the room. ^[Where would you store something useful?]

## Help me find it.
Open the cabinet that you put the radio on, then search through the maintenance booklet. You'll find the third wrench on the last page.
