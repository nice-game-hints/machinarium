Space invaders! Move side to side, shoot all the aliens, and avoid their bullets.

# Any tips or tricks?
You can shoot the aliens' bullets to destroy them, and there are no penalties for missing, so shoot as often as you like.

# Anything else?
Blue aliens are worth 3 points, red aliens are worth 5, and yellow aliens are worth 7. Motherships will sometimes enter the top of the screen, and are worth 30 points.

# Anything else?
You have three lives, and your ultimate goal is to reach 1000 points for a coin. There's not much more to the game, so good luck!
