title: Getting some sunflower oil
order: 10
---

The wheelchair-bound robot has been waiting for some sunflower oil for *ages*!

# What do I need?
When you helped the band earlier, a local resident wasn't very happy about it. She even threw a few plant pots at you.

# How does that help me?
One of the plant pots had a plant in it. With any luck, that little green stem will grow into a sunflower.

# How long will that take?
In the right environment, it'll only take a few seconds! ^[Soil helps. Plant-growing beams do, too.]

## Help me out.
Head back to the greenhouse and put the plant into the empty pot. You can then move the plant-growing beam in front of it, and switch it on for some sunflower seeds.

# What now?
If slide deck 1 was all about bugs, then slide deck 2 must be about plants. Check it out for a clue to your next step.

## Help me out.
One of deck 2's slides is all about sunflowers - and it seems you can get sunflower oil by putting the seeds into a grinder. Lucky for you, there's one right outside the greenhouse! Just don't forget to put the can below the pipe where the oil will emerge.

# What now?
A can full of sunflower oil will make the wheelchair-bound robot very happy. Go make his day and [see what it gets you.](arcade)
