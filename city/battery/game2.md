title: The second arcade cabinet
order: 40
---

This one's a bit harder than space invaders! See [these hints](arcade) for help powering it up.

# What is the objective?
To get the small blue dot through the exit, which is usually unlocked when a red square is moved inside the larger red square. The dot can enter the shapes around it to move them, but cannot go through them or move them in a direction that would make the dot leave the square.

## Help me with the first puzzle.
Enter the small red square, move up, then move right. You can then go through the exit without leaving the squares.
