title: Powering up the arcade
order: 20
---

Heck yeah, a ticket to enter the arcade! You can find it at the edge of the bridge where you 'borrowed' the cat.

# What do we have here?
The games are all switched off, but it looks like the machine on the left can power them up.

# How?
Hop on the bicycle seat and get those legs moving!

# What now?
That got the [first game](game1) working! If you want to power up the second or third, a lever on the side can be pulled down to direct the power their way.
