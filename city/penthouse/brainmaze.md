title: The brain maze
order: 50
---

This is more of a mini-game than a puzzle, so these hints will give you a few directions.

# What do I need to do?
Your first task is to find the golden key that the game shows when you first connect to the brain.

# Where should I go first?
From your starting point, keep going right - taking care to avoid the enemies - and continue past a large 'C'. Follow the path down, then head left to find the key.

# What now?
Backtrack to the large 'C', where your key will unlock a gun. With it, you'll need to hunt down all of the red enemies in the maze.

# Where are they?
Look closely at the edges of the screen; you'll see little red arrows that will direct you toward the enemies. If you take too much damage, look out for blue '+' symbols throughout the maze that will restore your health.

# Any tips?
* Ammo is unlimited, but health is not - shooting wildly can certainly help if you're getting cornered.
* Most enemies take two hits before dying, so don't hold back.
* Most of the maze is quite linear; look out for landmarks like the big 'C', or strangely-shaped rooms to keep track of where you've been.

# Hooray!
Your hard work got you another lamp for the elevator - it's time to head down to the basement and [free Berta!](berta)
