title: On the roof
order: 70

Reunited at last! Let's get out of here!

# What do we have here?
The helicopter on the roof would be the perfect exit vehicle, but the ladder to reach it hasn't been deployed. Maybe the panel on the left could help?

# Hmm...
'7.0: 108'. You'll need to find a place where you can input those numbers. ^[It seems to be a frequency for a radio.]

## Tell me what to do.
Head back inside the dome, and look at the radio machine on the left side of the room. You can use the left dial to select '108' and right dial to select '7'.W

# What now?
The radio has started playing a very specific tune - and the panel on the side of the dome wants you to repeat it. Hope you've got a good ear for musical notes!

# Nudge me in the right direction.
From left to right, the first few notes are:
* 1
* 4
* 2

## Give me the solution.
* 1
* 4
* 2
* 3
* 5
* 2
* 3

# What now?
The ladder is only active for a few seconds, even after getting the sequence right. You might need some help. ^[What are friends for?]

## Tell me what to do.
When the ladder is active, click on the '+' shape near Berta to keep it in place. Freedom at last!

# Thanks for playing and reading!
