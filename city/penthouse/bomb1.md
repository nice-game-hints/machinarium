title: Reaching the bomb
order: 20
---

You can see the bomb by peeking down the toilet, but reaching it is another matter entirely.

# What do I need to do?
The toilet's a bit too big to squeeze through. Moving it out of the way would be a good start.

# What do I need?
The cleaning machine in the trophy room is probably strong enough to do the job, but you'll need an item to connect it to the the toilet.

# Hmm...
The chandelier in the trophy room would provide an excellent grip - if you cut it down.

# How do I do that?
A pair of scissors is on a high-up shelf in the bathroom. You could stand on the cleaning robot to reach them, but it's not moving. ^[No power?]

## Help me out.
Turn on the power with a panel near the elevator, then pull a lever on the left side of the room down - twice - to send the robot into the bathroom. You can then climb on top of it to reach the scissors.

# What now?
You can pull the lever up to bring the cleaning robot back into the trophy room, but cutting the chandelier down now might be dangerous. ^[Zap!]

## Tell me what to do.
You should turn off the power in the same way you turned it on before using the scissors to cut down the chandelier.

## What's next?
Almost done - switch the power back on, attach the chandelier to the cleaning robot, then send it into the bathroom where you can put the chandelier in the toilet. The toilet will finally be moved aside when you summon the cleaning robot back into the trophy room.

# What now?
The hole's much easier to fit into! But how are you going to reach the bomb safely? ^[There's no rope in this bathroom - what's the next best thing?]

## Help me out.
Click on the toilet paper dispenser to lower yourself and come face-to-face with [the bomb.](bomb2)
