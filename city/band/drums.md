title: The Drummer
order: 10

His drum was broken, then swallowed. Getting a new one is probably for the best.

# Where will I find one?
You don't need to find a perfect replacement - just something that will create a nice sound when hit.

# What do you suggest?
A barrel would make a pretty good drum. Try looking around for one. ^[What kind of liquid is usually stored in barrels?]

# Tell me where to look.
Visit the bar with a big neon sign near the band. Inside, you'll find a nice, empty barrel - and an eagle-eyed bartender.

# What do I need to do?
You'll need to distract the bartender, so watch him closely to get some ideas.

## What do I do?
Every so often, the bartender finds a fly and looks around nervously. Letting a bunch of flies loose would really ruin his day - and while he's dealing with them, you could steal the barrel.

# Where will I find flies?
Tons of flies are buzzing around a nasty-looking vat outside the bar. You'll need to find something sticky to collect a few of them, though.

# Something sticky?
Sticky traps are a great way to deal with flies. ^[The bartender's clearly having trouble with them - maybe he's deployed countermeasures?]

## Help me out.
Head back inside the bar, then stretch to reach the sticky trap hanging from the shelf. You can use it to collect a few flies, set them loose in the bar, and click the barrel to 'borrow' it while the bartender is distracted.
