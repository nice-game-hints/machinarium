title: The Saxophonist
order: 20
---

His saxophone's keys are all gone! Luckily, you can find them all in one place. Unluckily, you'll need to beat the game's most infamous puzzle.

# What do I need to do?
Pay another visit to the bar next to the band, and talk to the bot sitting at the table. He'll challenge you to a game, and you'll get the saxophone keys for winning.

# What are the rules?
You need to connect five bolts in a row - diagonally, horizontally, or vertically - before your opponent does. Your opponent is a master of the game, though, and will laugh every time you lose - but don't let it get to you.

# Hmm...
Every time you start the mini-game, your opponent goes first - and usually starts in a different spot. If you've never played Gomoku, it may be worth 'mirroring' your opponent's moves to get an idea for how this all works.

## How do I win?
Annoyingly, nobody has a sure-fire strategy - and the AI seems to favour different tactics depending on the platform you're playing on. There is hope, however.
* Visit this website: http://www.javascripter.net/games/xo/xo.htm
* Set the board size to 10x10
* Put the robot's moves into the website, then copy the website's moves into the game.
* If you see a 5-in-a-row, jump on it ASAP!


This won't *guarantee* victory, but has a pretty decent success rate.

## I WON!
Congratulations! Pick up the various nuts and bolts, then bring them to the saxophonist. If you're struggling to scoop them all up, they are:
* On top of the door's porthole
* Under your stool
* On the floor near the table
* On the bar
* On the floor near the exit
