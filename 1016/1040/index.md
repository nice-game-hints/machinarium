title: Where can I get a battery to power the guard's toy?
---
# Hint 1
First of all, have you helped the old wheelchair robot yet?

# Hint 2
If not, you will need to do that first.

# Hint 3
[How can I make sunflower oil for the wheelchair robot in town?][1018]

# Hint 4
Once you've done that, he will drop a bandage, which you need, and an arcade pass, which will get you into the arcade near the bridge where you caught the cat earlier.

# Hint 5
[The Arcade][1068]

# Hint 6
Once you have the two coins from the arcade, buy two batteries from the machine near the fountain (on the far right side of the screen).

# Hint 7
These are AA type batteries, and the guard needed a nine volt.

# Hint 8
Thankfully, we can use the bandage.

# Hint 9
Just tie the two batteries together -- that'll do.

# Hint 10
Give the battery to the guard and he will allow you into the elevator.
