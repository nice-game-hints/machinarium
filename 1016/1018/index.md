# Hint 1
First off, you'll need sunflower seeds.

# Hint 2
The greenhouse is the place to find those, so if you've not been there yet, do so now.

# Hint 3
[The Greenhouse][919]

# Hint 4
Once you have the seeds, and the can the old man gave you to collect the oil in, you are ready to go.

# Hint 5
Head to the broken bridge and place the can under the yellow pressing machine next to the drain.

# Hint 6
Now just pull the handle a few times with your mouse to collect the sunflower oil in the can.

# Hint 7
You can then return to the old man by heading down the pipe next to the guard on this screen, and heading up the stairs as a shortcut back to the fountain.
