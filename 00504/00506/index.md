title: How can I reach the loudspeaker at the upper-right?

# Hint 1
There's a robot in there guarding it.. see?

# Hint 2
You're going to need to find a way to make him leave his post.

# Hint 3
Perhaps he finishes work at a certain time? If he did, what clock would he likely tell the time by?

# Hint 4
That large one overlooking the building on the far side, perhaps?

# Hint 5
You can actually control the time on that clock, using an item found on this screen.

# Hint 6
There's a crank in the foreground in front of the fountain, and by jamming it in the hole on the wall to the right of the door of the clock building, you can turn it and change the time on the clock.

# Hint 7
First off, you're going to need to speak with the robot sitting by that building. They will mention an infinity symbol.

# Hint 8
So, let's try to make it infinity o'clock.

# Hint 9
See those notes on the walls to the side of the clock? Look for one that indicates how to make infinity o'clock.

# Hint 10
You'll see that infinity o'clock occurs at VII on the outer face, and then three times on the inner face, the sideways S, the sideways hourglass shape, and the circle with a dot on it.

# Hint 11
So, turn the crank until you've made any of these three combinations using the two hands.

# Hint 12
Now that the robot has left, we can read the note they were sitting in front of. It tells you how to make a new time, star o'clock.

# Hint 13
Make that time (by setting the teardrop icon and VI on the outer face), and the guard will leave.

# Hint 14
You are now free to climb up and take his loudspeaker.
