title: On the roof, how can I reach the top of the dome?
---
# Hint 1
The little pedals at the left of the roof are the key here.

# Hint 2
Speaking of keys, this is a music note puzzle.

# Hint 3
Did you see those numbers written on the panel?

# Hint 4
They say 7.0, 108.

# Hint 5
Intriguing!

# Hint 6
Head inside the dome again and input those numbers into the yellow machine to hear a seven-note melody.

# Hint 7
Now head up and replicate that melody on the machine above.

# Hint 8
The correct combination of pedals (from left to right as one to five) is as follows:

# Hint 9
One, four, two, three, five, two, three.

# Hint 10
This will cause the steps to pop out, and then recede quickly.

# Hint 11
Thankfully, there's someone nearby to keep them open.

# Hint 12
Click on the female robot just as the steps pop out and she will turn the handle to keep them out.

# Hint 13
Now just climb the stairs, and you've finished Machinarium! Congrats :)
