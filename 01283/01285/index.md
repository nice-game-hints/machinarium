title: How can I save the female robot?
---
# Hint 1
First off, you're going to need to get the bad guys out of the way.

# Hint 2
Find a way to unlock that tube under them and get them to fall into it.

# Hint 3
If you hit it with the sledgehammer, it just rocks back and forth.

# Hint 4
Did you notice there's one other thing down here you can hit with the hammer though?

# Hint 5
Break glass in case of emergency?

# Hint 6
There's a key in there.

# Hint 7
It's not the key to the padlock though.. sorry!

# Hint 8
Look around for another lock to open.

# Hint 9
You might have to backtrack, but only slightly.

# Hint 10
There's a little locked panel to the right of the elevator. Open it, and grab the canister of liquid nitrogen from inside.

# Hint 11
Use THAT with the padlock to freeze it, then hit it again to drain the bad guys out of the pipe.

# Hint 12
You will then take her back to the dome -- head outside through the door to the right, and prepare for the very last puzzle.
