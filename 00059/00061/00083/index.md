title: How can I make the cone light blue?
---
# Hint 1
Did you notice there were more cones underneath the one you took?

# Hint 2
Take some more.

# Hint 3
Eventually, once you've picked them all up, you'll find a can of blue paint beneath.

# Hint 4
Grab it.

# Hint 5
It's blue, but it's not LIGHT blue.

# Hint 6
Though thankfully there's a vat of white paint to mix it with here.

# Hint 7
First off, dip your hat in the white paint, to take the orange off and make it fully white.

# Hint 8
Now tip your blue paint in, and dip the cone once more to make it light blue.
