title: How can I repair the lift once it has fuel from the kitchen?

# Hint 1
See that red knob?

# Hint 2
Pull it.

# Hint 3
Now that the engine's going, we need to solve the puzzle on the panel.

# Hint 4
The goal here is to do as the little indication at the bottom of the panel says: switch the red and grey pegs.

# Hint 5
This means that the two red pegs should be in the top left and top right corners, and the two grey pegs should be in the lower corners.

# Hint 6
It's very easy to do -- just shift them around the points of the stars in a circle until you've got it.

# Hint 7
When you have, you can use the up or down arrows on the resulting piece of metal that folds out to travel up or down.
