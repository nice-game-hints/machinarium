title: What should I do with the prisoner's arm?
---
# Hint 1
Use it to reach through that little mouse-hole at the lower-left of the cell.

# Hint 2
Squish yourself down so that your arms reach to that level, and then use the prisoner's arm to extend your own reach.

# Hint 3
Ignore the bizarre characters in the middle cell, and reach right through to the mouse holes on the left of THEIR cell.

# Hint 4
Use the upper one, the lower one leads nowhere.

# Hint 5
There's a cupboard in the far room, with a broom on it. Three jabs with the arm and the broom will fall off, and you can collect it.

# Hint 6
Doing so will cause you to give the prisoner his arm back. The broom's what you need.
