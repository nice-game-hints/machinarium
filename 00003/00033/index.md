title: And how about my missing arm?
---
# Hint 1
The arm's a little more well-hidden. Did you see where it ended up when you first crashed into that bin?

# Hint 2
It ended up in the water at the right of the area.

# Hint 3
What's the easiest way to get something from some water?

# Hint 4
Say, something that might bite?

# Hint 5
You can construct a primitive fishing rod using the parts here.

# Hint 6
There's a magnet, that'll work as our "bait" for your magnetic arm.

# Hint 7
You can also grab a line from that spool of thread.

# Hint 8
Then, connect the two in your inventory.

# Hint 9
As for the pole itself, there's one next to the water, though it may not be apparent right away.

# Hint 10
Kick over that upright metal pole, and then attach your makeshift fishing device to it.

# Hint 11
You can now fish up the arm, and in doing so, pass along to the next screen.
