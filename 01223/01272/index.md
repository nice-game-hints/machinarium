# Hint 1
It's the final bulb for the elevator.

# Hint 2
So go place it in there and draw the shape he showed you.

# Hint 3
It's an eight-pointed star, so draw this the normal way. Start in any position, and keep moving in twos in either direction until you get back to your starting point.)

# Hint 4
The elevator will then move to the lower floor, and... ENDGAME!
