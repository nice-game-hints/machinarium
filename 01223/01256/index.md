title: How can I play the game in the big robot's mind?
---
# Hint 1
This is an action mini-game. I know, I know, action, boo! Right? It's actually quite easy. :)

# Hint 2
Just move your cursor around, find the key, get the gun from the cabinet, and shoot thirty-three of the bad guys to end the game.

# Hint 3
From your starting position move right, right, right, down, left, left, left, up, and down around the bend to reach the key.

# Hint 4
Then move up, down (around the bend), right, right, right, up, left, and left to find the gun in the cage.

# Hint 5
Now just run around madly shooting at every red bad guy you can see until you get all thirty-three of 'em.
