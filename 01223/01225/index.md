# Hint 1
Okay, this is one of the game's most complicated puzzles.

# Hint 2
You need to move the green beads into the green area, for each of the two puzzles you see.

# Hint 3
It's kinda tricky to give direct hints here, but for the top one, try to do as follows:

# Hint 4
Move the yellow beads up and then move the green beads around the top corner. Now, move the black chain around to form a question mark shape (without the dot) around the top-right.

# Hint 5
Now just slide the yellows all the way along to the right, and the greens down into the gap, move the blacks around where the greens were, move the yellows back, and move the greens into place.

# Hint 6
Now for the second puzzle, we have blues incorporated too, to make it a little trickier.

# Hint 7
Move the blacks all the way to the top, the greens to the middle (vertically) and the yellows to the lower-right. Then, put the blues on top, the greens in the lower-left, and the blacks in the middle.

# Hint 8
Now, move the greens to the right near the yellows and the blacks into the lower-left corner. Then, the blues to the middle (horizontally) and the greens to the top where they belong.
