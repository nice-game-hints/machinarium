# Hint 1
See the puzzle on the wall?

# Hint 2
You can find the solution somewhere in this room.

# Hint 3
But it's going to take a fair bit of digging to illuminate the correct solution.

# Hint 4
Or project it, actually.

# Hint 5
You need to fix the projector and place the slides from the desk in it.

# Hint 6
To fix the projector, first off, you'll need to solve the puzzles with the grid.

# Hint 7
[How do I solve the puzzles on this control panel?][921]

# Hint 8
After doing so, you can push the buttons at the bottom of that grid to turn on the laser and the projector.

# Hint 9
First off, you'll need to move the laser and grab the stick that was hiding behind it.

# Hint 10
Next, feed that stick to the venus fly trap up above, and reach into its mouth to retrieve the magnifier for the projector.

# Hint 11
Place it on it, and push the right button on the grid control panel to turn it on.

# Hint 12
One set of slides is a red herring and just contains pictures of plants.

# Hint 13
The other contains pictures of animals. Flick through these slides using the remote control.

# Hint 14
You'll soon see a picture of a winged insect with red dots on its wings that looks an awful lot like the door panel.

# Hint 15
Click on the positions of those red dots.

# Hint 16
On the door panel, light up the lights on the insect's back that correspond to those eight red dots.

# Hint 17
This will open the door.
