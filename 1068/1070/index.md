# Hint 1
You need to power them yourself, I'm afraid.

# Hint 2
First off... GIVE UP on number three. It'll never work. End of.

# Hint 3
However, you will need to power up games numbered one and two.

# Hint 4
See the exercise bike / generator thing at the left?

# Hint 5
Switch the switch there to either 1 or 2 and cycle using your cursor until you've lit the bulb atop the machine in question.

# Hint 6
Repeat this for the other game.
