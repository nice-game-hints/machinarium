title: How can I convince the wrench-bot to help me?
---
# Hint 1
He wants a new stereo!

# Hint 2
You need two items to make this work. One you will find by helping each of

[The Musicians](/00687/index.md)


# Hint 4
, and the other can be found at

[The Fountain](/00504/index.md)


# Hint 6
.

# Hint 7
Combine the stereo with the loudspeaker, and place it on the table.

# Hint 8
The wrench-bot will now help you with the pipe, and will give you a red valve in the process, similar to the one hanging on the wall.
